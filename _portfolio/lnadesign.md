The development of high-performance receiver systems is crucial for modern wireless communication technologies, including Bluetooth, WLAN, and other radio-frequency applications. A key component in these systems is the Low Noise Amplifier (LNA), which is responsible for amplifying weak signals while introducing minimal noise.

This project presents the design and simulation of an LNA operating at 2.4 GHz (S-Band) with a 100 MHz bandwidth. The objective is to enhance the performance of existing commercial LNAs, such as the SST12LN01, by achieving a gain greater than 16 dB and a noise figure below 1.5 dB. To achieve these performance metrics, a Silicon-Germanium NPN RF BFP620 transistor from Infineon Technologies was selected due to its superior noise and gain characteristics.

The design process involved stability analysis, impedance matching using Smith charts, and computer simulations in AWR Design Software. Various design considerations, including maximum gain and minimum noise configurations, were explored to balance noise performance and amplification efficiency. The final design successfully achieved a noise figure of 1.29 dB and a transducer gain of 17.05 dB, surpassing the initial target specifications.

With its enhanced bandwidth of 327 MHz, this LNA design offers improved performance for wireless communication applications, making it a viable candidate for integration into advanced RF receiver systems.
