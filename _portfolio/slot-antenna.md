This project explores the impact of the physical characteristics of slot antennas on their resonant frequency and bandwidth, focusing on achieving a target resonant frequency of 2.45 GHz. Slot antennas, characterized by a slot cut into a metallic surface, are widely used in radar systems, microwave communications, and various other applications due to their simplistic design and effective radiation properties. The research delves into the relationship between the antenna's physical parameters—specifically slot length, substrate height, and feed offset—and its electromagnetic performance. By employing ANSYS HFSS Antenna Toolkit for simulations, the study demonstrates that variations in these physical properties significantly affect the resonant frequency and bandwidth of the antenna. The initial design, aimed at 2.45 GHz, resulted in a resonant frequency of 2.16 GHz with a return loss of -13.47 dB, prompting further parametric analysis. Results indicated that increasing the slot length or substrate height decreases the resonant frequency, while the bandwidth is positively correlated with slot length and inversely related to both substrate height and feed offset. These findings offer crucial insights for optimizing slot antenna designs to meet specific frequency and bandwidth requirements, enhancing their performance in practical applications.
