This report presents the design and simulation of a dual-band circularly polarized annular ring patch antenna for GPS-Aided GEO-Augmented Navigation (GAGAN) receivers. The proposed antenna, designed using Ansys HFSS software, operates at the L1 (1575.42 MHz) and L5 (1176.45 MHz) frequencies, ensuring compactness and ease of design for portable navigation applications. Key features include the use of a single coaxial feed for simplified setup, circular polarization to mitigate polarization mismatch, and enhanced gain for improved signal reception and transmission. Simulation results, including return loss, radiation pattern, realized gain, and directivity, demonstrate the antenna's effectiveness in meeting the requirements of GAGAN applications, despite some discrepancies due to unspecified parameters in the original design. The report concludes with a discussion of the antenna's potential advantages and limitations, highlighting its suitability for various sectors, including aviation, railways, security, and telecommunications.
