I am an enthusiastic engineering student with a strong focus on antenna design, machine learning and software development, currently pursuing dual degrees in Electronics and Communications Engineering and Aeronautical Engineering at [Istanbul Technical University.](https://www.itu.edu.tr)

In my professional experience, I have worked as a Machine Learning Engineering Intern at [Baykar Technologies](https://baykartech.com/tr/), where I utilized computer vision libraries such as OpenCV and TensorFlow to develop efficient algorithms for object detection and quality control. This role honed my skills in Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and PyCharm for coding, debugging, and testing.

Prior to this, I was a Test Engineering Intern at [Aselsan](https://www.aselsan.com/tr), engaging in projects involving LoRa E32 modules and Arduino Uno for long-range communication. I developed a circuit and a C# interface for customizing LoRa E32 parameters, ensuring stable communication through thorough testing.

As an Undergraduate Research Assistant at [Bountenna Antennas & Propagation Research Lab](https://bountenna.bogazici.edu.tr), I delved into electromagnetic wave propagation and antenna design, contributing to IoHT applications. I gained expertise in using simulation tools like ANSYS HFSS and CST.

My long-term Software Engineering internship at [Turkish Aerospace](https://www.tusas.com) provided valuable hands-on experience in software development with C and C++, enhancing my understanding of aerospace industry requirements. I also completed certifications in machine learning and systems engineering during this time.

Beyond my academic and professional endeavors, I served as the Editor in Chief of [arÄ±24](https://ari24.com), organized editorial content, and managed sponsorship deals. Additionally, I coordinated [World Cube Association](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2017BICE01) competitions, achieved success, and broke Turkish national records. I enjoy traveling around the world, taking photos, and skiing. I was also a professional swimmer and attended the Turkish National Championship in high school.
